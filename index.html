Tasks Explorer is a freeware opensource computer program providing functionality for collecting extended information about processes running in system in real time. 


Application Tasks Explorer was designed as alternative to Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Activity Monitor&#8221;, as information providing &#8220;Activity Monitor&#8221; does not correspond with the needs of software developers and advanced users. Process Explorer from Sysinternals whose features are needed in Mac OS X was selected as a standard.

    </a>
    
The system utility displays extended information about Mach-O executed files and libraries. MachoViewer has been designed as a part of Tasks Explorer and it also was released as separate application.
